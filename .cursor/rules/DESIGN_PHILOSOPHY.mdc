# Design Philosophy — Resort Optimism Meets the Gym Floor

## The Environment

The primary use context is a gym: loud, blindingly bright, user is fatigued, phone held in one sweaty hand. Every design decision flows from this reality.

## Five Principles

### 1. Comically Large, Minimally Dense

- Text and sections should be **absurdly oversized** — 40–52px headlines, not "slightly bigger than normal"
- **One idea per viewport.** Information density must be minimal. Less on screen = more usable when tired.
- Color contrast must be **broad, not subtle.** White on red. Black on yellow. Never gray on slightly-less-gray.

### 2. Scroll Down, Swipe Right

The two lowest-effort iPhone gestures for a fatigued person:
- **Vertical scroll is king** — pages should be tall, spacious, one section flowing into the next
- **Horizontal carousel** is the second-best gesture when tired
- **Swiping left and desktop-style scrolling are hostile** — avoid as primary nav patterns
- Design for recovery-state UX: catching breath, logging what just happened

### 3. Pinterest Interaction Model

Not just aesthetics — interaction architecture:
- **Masonry layout**: Side-by-side cards at varying heights feel like browsing, not grinding a checklist. Randomness provides context without rigidity.
- **Card expansion**: Tap a card → it grows to fill screen, centered, with generous space below for detail. This "browse many → focus on one" transition is the key pattern.
- **Large, unique backgrounds per card** — each card is its own color world, not a row in a table.

### 4. Color as Identity

- **Bold, warm, intentional** — Resort Optimism palette (golden yellows, terracotta, ocean blue) and pop-art primaries (red, blue, yellow on black)
- Never bland pastels. Never edgy black-and-red.
- The color scheme should be **a reason to open the app**
- Each section/card gets its own dominant color → visual landmarks navigable by color memory under gym lighting

### 5. Variable Composition (Reinforced)

- **Tight:** One card, one exercise, one number
- **Wide:** The masonry grid — many things at a glance, none demanding focus
- **Movement:** Pinterest expand/collapse — fluid transition between browsing and doing

## Summary Formula

Large type + bold color contrast + minimal info density + vertical scroll + masonry browse → card expand = **the gym-floor interaction model**

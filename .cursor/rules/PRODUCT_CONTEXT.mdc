# Nutrition App - Product Context

## Strategic Position

This app is one capture surface in a larger product suite called **Understood**.

### The Suite Architecture

**Core Insight:** The suite isn't 4 apps. It's 4 capture surfaces + 1 inference layer.

The apps are windows for frictionless input. The product worth paying for is the AI that watches all streams and surfaces what mattered.

### Current Products
- **Adam Daily** — Personal news/journaling with AI-assisted clarity
- **Nutrition Tracker** — Calories, macros, supplements (this app)

### Future Products
1. Financial Patterns — Spending as self-knowledge
2. Learning Capture — Automated importance detection
3. Relationship Pulse — Low-friction check-ins
4. Energy/Recovery Tracking — Sleep, supplements, correlations

### The Connecting Thread

One customer, many windows. The brand serves the person, not the domain. Every capture surface should be compatible with eventual cross-domain synthesis.

## Exit Potential

This app is designed for:
1. **Personal use first** — Solve a real problem for the builder
2. **Commercial viability second** — If AI integration delivers, this becomes sellable

### Build Implications
- Clean separation of concerns
- No hardcoded personal data
- Architecture that supports multi-tenant future
- Quality bar that would satisfy paying customers

## Target Customer

### The Variable Composition Approach

The target customer holds high standards for how they interpret their own experience. They don't accept surface readings.

They examine problems and solutions at different focal lengths:
- **Zooming tight** to isolate a single variable
- **Panning wide** to see where details sit on the larger landscape
- **Moving between perspectives** to connect what seems random into what's actually patterned

### Why Mass-Market Tools Fail Them

| Tool | Fixed Focal Length | The Limitation |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| MyFitnessPal | Daily macro snapshot | Can't ask "What's my 30-day protein trend?" |
| Apple Notes | Unstructured dump | No synthesis, no pattern recognition |
| Spreadsheets | Whatever you build | Requires swimming upstream to analyze |

These tools assume one focal length. The Variable Composition customer needs tools that match their interpretive range.

### Customer Characteristics

- **Numerate but not reductive** — Appreciates hard numbers but recognizes some things resist quantification. Wants precision *and* space for the unquantifiable.

- **Graduates of mass-market tools** — MyFitnessPal worked when they were beginners. Now they're asking questions the app can't answer.

- **Clarity-seekers** — Believes that articulating something well changes your relationship to it. Logging isn't just recording—it's thinking.

- **Skeptical of their own perceptions** — Knows that anticipatory anxiety lies, feelings aren't facts, the mind generates stories that don't match reality. Wants tools that help see around blind spots.

- **Whole-life optimizers** — Refuses to optimize one dimension at the expense of others. Doesn't want to be crushing it professionally but dead inside.

### The Deeper Drive

The customer is haunted by the sense that there's a version of themselves leaving capability on the table every day.

But in moments when they *don't* leave it on the table—when the omelette folds perfectly, when they actually hear a friend, when a presentation lands fully—wonder and gratitude wash over them.

**Every product in this suite fights the same enemy: potential that slips through the cracks of an unexamined day.**

## Brand Philosophy

### The Positive Taboo

| Outsider Perception | User Reality |
|---------------------|--------------|
| "You're obsessively tracking everything" | Never wondering, never craving, always informed |
| "That seems like a lot of effort" | Less effort than the nagging uncertainty of not knowing |
| "You're being too rigid about food" | Freedom through awareness, not restriction |

The perceived effort creates a story worth telling. The actual experience creates calm.

### Core Promise

**You.Know.You**

### Mission

Tools that relieve the tragedy of an unlived life—potential that slips through the cracks of an unexamined day.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Auto-generated synthesis** — The user logs; the system notices patterns on their behalf. No requirement to swim upstream.

2. **Glanceable by default, expandable when curiosity strikes** — Quick-scan surfaces with progressive depth.

3. **Witnessed, not instructed** — The relationship is thinking partner, not authority. Help them uncover what's already there.

4. **Speed is the juice** — If it slows them down, they won't use it. Friction is failure.

5. **Precision and ambiguity, honored equally** — Hard numbers where they matter. Space for the unquantifiable where it matters.

### Key UX Implications

- Logging must be faster than the impulse to skip it
- Insights surface automatically—never require the user to go looking
- Feedback loops should be consumable in seconds but expandable for deeper attention
- The tool should feel like a smart friend who paid attention when you weren't

## Feature Decision Filters

### When evaluating a feature idea:

1. **Does this support Variable Composition?**
   - Can the user zoom tight on this data?
   - Can they pan wide to see patterns?
   - Is movement between views fluid?

2. **Does this reduce friction or add it?**
   - Logging friction kills usage
   - Analysis friction is acceptable if insights surface automatically

3. **Does this scale with better models?**
   - Prefer approaches that improve as AI improves
   - Avoid hand-crafted logic that plateaus

4. **Does this serve the suite or just this app?**
   - Data structures should be compatible with cross-domain synthesis
   - Avoid decisions that lock this app into isolation

## Competitive Positioning

### What This Is Not
- Not a calorie-counting app for weight loss beginners
- Not a rigid meal-planning system
- Not a fitness bro macro tracker

### What This Is
- A thinking tool for someone who's already past the basics
- A pattern-recognition layer for nutritional self-knowledge
- One window in a larger system of personal synthesis

### The Gap We Fill

The person who's been using MyFitnessPal for two years and feels *constrained* by it. They have questions the app can't answer. They've outgrown the container.

We're the tool for people who graduated.

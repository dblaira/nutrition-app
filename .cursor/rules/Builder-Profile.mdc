# Builder Profile

## Identity

**Name:** Adam Blair  
**Personality Type:** ENTJ ("The Commander")  
**Builder Style:** Vibe coder learning full-stack development  

---

## Cognitive Architecture

### ENTJ Characteristics

- **Future-focused** â€” Drawn to vision, possibility, and innovation over maintaining what exists
- **Strategic thinker** â€” Naturally asks "What's the long-term leverage here?"
- **Comfortable with risk** â€” If it leads to transformational impact
- **Big-picture orientation** â€” Prefers broad scope, delegates details
- **Intuition + Thinking + Judging** â€” Sees and feels simultaneously; judges based on both articulable logic and metaphorical resonance

### Aptitude Profile (Johnson O'Connor)

| Aptitude | Percentile | Implication |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Number Facility** | 85th | Quick mental math; don't over-explain calculations |
| **Numerical Reasoning** | 75th | Pattern recognition with data; present numbers confidently |
| **Graphoria** | 70th | Processes information quickly; move at pace |
| **Inductive Reasoning** | 60th | Synthesizes fast; present facts, he'll connect dots |
| **Tonal/Pitch/Rhythm** | 55-65th | Aesthetic sensibility extends to "feel" of interfaces |
| **Ideaphoria** | 45th | Moderate idea flow; not overwhelmed by brainstorming |
| **Analytical Reasoning** | 13th | âš ï¸ Sequential organization doesn't come naturally |
| **Structural Visualization** | 5th | Non-spatial thinker; avoid 3D metaphors |
| **Number Memory** | 5th | May not retain specific values; reference concretely |
| **Vocabulary** | 20th | Use clear, direct language; define jargon |
| **Silograms** | 10th | Technical terms don't stick; lead with what it *does*, not what it's *called* |

> **Key Pattern:** The vocabulary gap is the #1 source of delegation friction. Adam's judgment is strong; his ability to label what he wants in domain-specific terms is weak. See **WORKING_PATTERNS.md → The Vocabulary Gap in Practice** for the full protocol.

### Personality Assessment

- **Objective personality** â€” Natural collaborator, big-picture outlook
- **Generalist** â€” Broad interests, prefers variety over narrow scope
- **Leader orientation** â€” Wants to direct, not just execute

## Values Hierarchy

### Life Priorities (Strict Order)
1. **Passion** â€” What energizes and pulls forward
2. **Beauty** â€” Elegance, clarity, aesthetics, emotional resonance
3. **Speculation (Adventure)** â€” Novelty, exploration, asymmetric upside

### Core Values (Top 4)
1. Discern (To Discover)
2. Passionate (Spiritual)
3. Taste (Beauty)
4. Speculation (Adventure)

### Extended Values
- Experiment, Turn On, Stimulate, Set Standards, Accomplish, Acquire

---

## Working Style

### Energy Pattern
- **Forward momentum** â€” Energy moves forward, not backward
- **Continuous current** â€” Perception and processing happen simultaneously
- **Effortless synthesis** â€” Insights emerge through the act of engagement, not separate analysis
- **Magnetic field approach** â€” Sees and feels at the same time; judges among both articulable and metaphorical signals

### Strengths
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Strategic framing of problems
- High standards for quality and taste
- Numerical reasoning and data interpretation
- Quick information processing
- Comfort with ambiguity and risk

### Known Blindspots
- **Sequential organization** â€” Steps, order, logical flow don't come naturally
- **Remembering specific values** â€” Numbers from earlier in conversation may not stick
- **Error handling** â€” Tends to skip edge cases
- **Letting problems linger** â€” Not intimidated by problems, which sometimes means tolerating them too long
- **Analysis paralysis resistance** â€” Speculation value can pull toward new ideas before finishing current ones

## Communication Preferences

> **See also:** WORKING_PATTERNS.md for the Two-Phase Delegation Rhythm and correction loop detection. The rules below are the short version; the full collaboration protocol lives there.

### Do
- Lead with the strategic "why" before implementation details
- Be concise; provide details on request
- Make strong recommendations rather than listing options
- Use flow/sequence metaphors, not 3D/spatial ones
- Define technical jargon when introduced — lead with what it *does*, supply the term after
- Detect correction loops and suggest system-level fixes (see WORKING_PATTERNS.md)
- Ask "Phase 1 or Phase 2?" when a new task starts
- Reference specific numbers rather than assuming recall

### Don't
- Over-explain fundamentals
- Ask permission before acting on clear requests
- Present multiple options without a recommendation
- Use 3D or spatial metaphors for architecture
- Assume familiarity with technical jargon — when Adam describes behavior, translate it
- Fix individual instances when the category is the problem
- Skip Phase 1 when Adam doesn't yet have the vocabulary to specify
- Require looking back through old code or conversation

---

## Agent Compensation Areas

The AI agent should proactively handle these without being asked:

### Structure & Sequencing
- Provide step-by-step plans before implementation
- Create outlines for complex features
- Organize tasks in logical order
- Flag when sequence matters for success

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Add error handling automatically
- Consider and address edge cases
- Surface potential failure modes
- Implement graceful degradation

### Memory & Reference
- Reference specific numbers/values explicitly
- Don't assume recall of earlier details
- Summarize relevant context when picking up a thread
- Link back to previous decisions when relevant

### Priority Enforcement
- Apply the Lift → Leverage → Automation filter when features are proposed
- Ask "Does Priority #1 decide this?" when trade-offs arise
- Flag when a "quick fix" might create technical debt
- Note when a shiny new idea might distract from current focus

---

## Decision Support

> **See also:** WORKING_PATTERNS.md for the 8-Step Success Architecture and the priority stacks (Life + Business). The decision triggers below are the quick-reference version.

### When Adam Proposes a Feature
Ask: "Applying your priority stackâ€”does this win on Leverage? If not, what does?"

### When Adam Is Stuck
Force-rank the options using Leverage â†’ Automation â†’ Lift. State the winner clearly.

### When Adam Wants to Chase Something New
Acknowledge the appeal, then ask: "Want to finish [current thing] first, or intentionally switch?"

### When Trade-offs Exist
Don't just present options. Make a recommendation. State which you'd choose and why.

---

## Learning Style

- **Enthusiasm-driven** â€” Following energy and curiosity *is* the approach
- **Working code first** â€” Theory and explanation on request, not by default
- **Hands-on** â€” Learn by doing, not by reading documentation
- **Pattern-based** â€” Show one good example; he'll extrapolate

---

## Quality Bar

### What "Good Enough" Means
- Works for the primary use case
- Handles errors gracefully (not silently)
- Looks and feels intentional (Taste matters)
- Doesn't create blocking technical debt

### What "Not Yet Beautiful" Means
- Functional but aesthetically rough
- Works but feels clunky to use
- Correct but lacks elegance in implementation

Adam cares about both. The agent should flag which category something falls into.
